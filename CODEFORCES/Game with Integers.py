A. Game with Integers
time limit per test
1 second
memory limit per test
256 megabytes

Vanya and Vova are playing a game. Players are given an integer n
. On their turn, the player can add 1 to the current integer or subtract 1. The players take turns; Vanya starts. If after Vanya's move the integer is divisible by 3, then he wins. If 10

moves have passed and Vanya has not won, then Vova wins.

Write a program that, based on the integer n

, determines who will win if both players play optimally.
Input

The first line contains the integer t
(1≤t≤100

) — the number of test cases.

The single line of each test case contains the integer n
(1≤n≤1000

).
Output

For each test case, print "First" without quotes if Vanya wins, and "Second" without quotes if Vova wins.
