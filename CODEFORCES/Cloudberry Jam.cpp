// A. Cloudberry Jam

// The most valuable berry of the Karelian forests is cloudberry. To make jam from cloudberries, you take equal amounts of berries and sugar and cook them. Thus, if you have 2
// kg of berries, you need 2 kg of sugar. However, from 2 kg of berries and 2 kg of sugar, you will not get 4 kg of jam, as one might expect, but only 3 kg, since some of the jam evaporates during cooking. Specifically, during standard cooking, exactly a quarter (or 25%

// ) of the jam evaporates.

// How many kilograms of cloudberries are needed to prepare n
// 3

// -kilogram jars of jam?
// Input

// Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer t
// (1≤t≤104

// ) — the number of test cases. The following lines describe the test cases.

// Each test case contains a single integer n
// (1≤n≤108

// ) — the number of jars of jam that need to be prepared.
// Output

// For each test case, output a single integer — the amount of berries needed for the jam in kilograms.
// Example
// Input
// Copy

// 2
// 1
// 3

// Output
// Copy

// 2
// 6

// Note

// For the test case 1
// , explanations are given in the text of the statement — to prepare 1 jar of jam, you need 2

// kilograms of cloudberries.

// Consider the test case 2
// : if we take 6 kilograms of berries and 6 kilograms of sugar, we get (6+6)⋅34=9 kilograms of jam; which gives 93=3

// jars of jam.
