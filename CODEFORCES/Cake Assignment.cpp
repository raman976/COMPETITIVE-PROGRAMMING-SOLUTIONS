// Chocola and Vanilla love cakes. Today, the manager of a cake shop gave them a total of 2k+1
// cakes. The cakes were distributed evenly, so each of them initially received 2k

// cakes.

// However, Chocola and Vanilla now want to redistribute the cakes such that Chocola ends up with exactly x
// cakes and Vanilla gets the remaining 2k+1−x

// cakes.

// In one step, they can perform exactly one of the following two operations:

//     Chocola gives half of her cakes to Vanilla. This operation is only allowed if Chocola currently has an even number of cakes.
//     Vanilla gives half of her cakes to Chocola. This operation is only allowed if Vanilla currently has an even number of cakes. 

// Your task is to determine the minimum number of steps required to reach the target distribution and to output any valid sequence of operations achieving that minimum.

// It can be proven that, under the given constraints, a valid solution always exists, and the minimum number of steps required is at most 120

// .
// Input

// Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
// (1≤t≤1000

// ). The description of the test cases follows.

// The first line of each test case contains two integers k
// and x (1≤k≤60, 1≤x≤2k+1−1) — each person initially received 2k cakes, and x

// is the number of cakes Chocola should have after redistribution.
// Output

// For each test case, output a single integer n
// (0≤n≤120

// ) representing the minimum number of steps required for them to redistribute the cakes accordingly.

// On the next line, output n
// integers o1,o2,…,on (oi=1 or oi=2), where oi=1 means that in the i-th step, Chocola gave half of her cakes to Vanilla (operation 1), and oi=2

// means that Vanilla gave half of her cakes to Chocola (operation 2).
// Example
// Input
// Copy

// 4
// 2 3
// 2 4
// 3 7
// 2 5

// Output
// Copy

// 2
// 2 1 
// 0

// 3
// 2 2 1 
// 2
// 1 2 

// Note

// In the first test case, they can use the following steps so that Chocola has exactly x=3
// cakes and Vanilla has exactly 2k+1−x=5 cakes. We use {a,b} to denote that Chocola currently has a cakes and Vanilla currently has b

// cakes.

// {4,4}−→−−o1=2{6,2}−→−−o2=1{3,5}

// In the second test case, Chocola already has exactly x=4
// cakes and Vanilla already has exactly 2k+1−x=4

// cakes, so no operations are required.

// In the third test case, they can use the following steps so that Chocola has exactly x=7
// cakes and Vanilla has exactly 2k+1−x=9

// cakes.

// {8,8}−→−−o1=2{12,4}−→−−o2=2{14,2}−→−−o3=1{7,9}
