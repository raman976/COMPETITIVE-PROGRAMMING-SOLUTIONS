// 1370. Increasing Decreasing String

// Hint

// You are given a string s. Reorder the string using the following algorithm:

//     Remove the smallest character from s and append it to the result.
//     Remove the smallest character from s that is greater than the last appended character, and append it to the result.
//     Repeat step 2 until no more characters can be removed.
//     Remove the largest character from s and append it to the result.
//     Remove the largest character from s that is smaller than the last appended character, and append it to the result.
//     Repeat step 5 until no more characters can be removed.
//     Repeat steps 1 through 6 until all characters from s have been removed.

// If the smallest or largest character appears more than once, you may choose any occurrence to append to the result.

// Return the resulting string after reordering s using this algorithm.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: s = "aaaabbbbcccc"
// Output: "abccbaabccba"
// Explanation: After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the first iteration, result = "abc"
// After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the first iteration, result = "abccba"
// First iteration is done. Now s = "aabbcc" and we go back to step 1
// After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabc"
// After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabccba"

// Example 2:

// Input: s = "rat"
// Output: "art"
// Explanation: The word "rat" becomes "art" after re-ordering it with the mentioned algorithm.

 

// Constraints:

//     1 <= s.length <= 500
//     s consists of only lowercase English letters.

class Solution {
public:
    string sortString(string s) {
        vector<int> freq(26, 0);
        for(char c : s) freq[c - 'a']++;

        string result = "";
        int remaining = s.size();

        while (remaining > 0) {

            // increasing order
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if (freq[i] > 0) {
                    result += char('a' + i);
                    freq[i]--;
                    remaining--;
                }
            }

            // decreasing order
            for (int i = 25; i >= 0; i--) {
                if (freq[i] > 0) {
                    result += char('a' + i);
                    freq[i]--;
                    remaining--;
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
